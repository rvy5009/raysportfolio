            I am a solutions-oriented and innovative Software Engineer who holds
            seven yearsâ€™ experience leading the operations for a small business
            in the transportation industry. As both a Web Developer and
            Automotive Technician, I have an innate ability to self-learn
            complicated concepts and translate this to intuitive solutions for
            the teams I manage and the clients I support. I seek the opportunity
            to work in a collaborative, client-facing team that places consumer
            experience at the center of what they do.
